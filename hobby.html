  <h1>  Hobbies </h1>
  <p>I enjoy immersing myself in various forms of entertainment, particularly playing games and reading. 
    I spend my free time diving into MMORPGs like The Legend of Neverland, where I explore vast virtual worlds 
    and take on thrilling adventures. I also enjoy the competitive nature of MOBAs like Mobile Legends, which 
    allows me to strategize and collaborate with teammates in fast-paced matches. Additionally, I'm an avid 
    reader of manhwa, where I find captivating stories and vibrant artwork that offer a unique escape into 
    different narratives and genres. These hobbies provide a perfect balance of excitement, strategy, and 
    relaxation.</p>
