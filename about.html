  <h1>Welcome to My Site!</h1>
  <p>This website is a personal project designed to showcase my HTML skills and practice web development. 
    My aim is to experiment with different HTML elements, layouts, and design techniques while refining my 
    coding abilities. This space serves as a platform for me to test out new ideas, explore best practices, 
    and demonstrate my progress in creating clean, functional, and aesthetically pleasing web pages. Feel free 
    to browse and see how Iâ€™m growing as a web developer!</p>
    <p>Below is the program languages that I know of:</p>
    <h3>1. Python</h3>
    <p>Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and wide range of applications, from web development to data science and AI. It supports multiple programming paradigms and has a large community and extensive libraries, making it popular among both beginners and experienced developers.</p>

    <h3>3. HTML</h3>
    <p>
      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the structure of web pages using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML is the foundation of web development, working alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.</p>

    <h3>4. CSS</h3>
    <p>
      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents on the web. It allows developers to apply styles like colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to elements, ensuring consistent design across web pages. CSS separates content from design, making web development more efficient and flexible.</p>
